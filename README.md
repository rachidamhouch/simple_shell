****simple_shell****
A simple UNIX command interpreter that provides a user interface to access and give orders to the operating system.

**Itâ€™s time for the famous Simple Shell project**

 This is one of the most anticipated project and also one that will challenge you a lot about everything you have learn so far:

>>Basics of programming

>>Basics of C

>>Basics of thinking like an engineer

>>Group work

>>and Learning how to learn


## Description
This is a command line interpreter, or shell, in the tradition of the first Unix shell written by Ken Thompson in 1971. This was made as a project for Holberton School. In this project we apply the knowledge that we have learned in C programming language.
Standard functions and system calls employed in simple_shell include:
   ```sh
   access, execve, exit, fork, free, malloc, read, signal, wait, write.
   ```
